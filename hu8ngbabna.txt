Writing code is easy; maintaining it is hard.If your code works the first time, check again.No code is better than bad code.There is no cloud, just someone else’s computer.A programmer’s life: Eat, Sleep, Code, Repeat.Programming is like solving puzzles all day, every day.Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
