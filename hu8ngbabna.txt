Your future self will hate you for this commit.The first step in optimization is not to do it.One does not simply write bug-free code.Keep calm and write Python.Git commit -m "Fixed it" (Famous last words).You can’t fix stupid, but you can refactor ugly code.If you like debugging, you’ll love JavaScript.Trust the process, but verify the output.Errors are just opportunities to learn.No code is better than bad code.It works on my machine!Code like you mean it.Trust the process, but verify the output.A single missing semicolon can ruin your whole day.Deadlines are suggestions, not rules.The best code is no code at all.Try, catch, cry.Real developers don’t need Stack Overflow… said no developer ever.Programming is just Googling the same thing over and over again.Bugs are not errors; they are unexpected features.If (code == ugly) { refactor(); }The real challenge in programming is working with other developers.The real challenge in programming is working with other developers.Just because it compiles doesn’t mean it works.The only code that’s truly secure is the code that doesn’t exist.Code like you care.Software developers are the only people who can make something out of nothing… and still break it.A bad day coding is better than a good day doing paperwork.Your code is only as good as your last commit.Writing code is easy; maintaining it is hard.You can’t fix stupid, but you can refactor ugly code.Trust the process, but verify the output.Version control: because "final_final_v2" is not a good filename.Don’t push on Fridays.Writing code is easy; maintaining it is hard.If your code works the first time, check again.No code is better than bad code.There is no cloud, just someone else’s computer.A programmer’s life: Eat, Sleep, Code, Repeat.Programming is like solving puzzles all day, every day.Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
