The only code that’s truly secure is the code that doesn’t exist.Code like you care.Software developers are the only people who can make something out of nothing… and still break it.A bad day coding is better than a good day doing paperwork.Your code is only as good as your last commit.Writing code is easy; maintaining it is hard.You can’t fix stupid, but you can refactor ugly code.Trust the process, but verify the output.Version control: because "final_final_v2" is not a good filename.Don’t push on Fridays.Writing code is easy; maintaining it is hard.If your code works the first time, check again.No code is better than bad code.There is no cloud, just someone else’s computer.A programmer’s life: Eat, Sleep, Code, Repeat.Programming is like solving puzzles all day, every day.Premature optimization is the root of all evil.
